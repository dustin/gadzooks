Webhook hooker.

The goal of this project is to make it easier for people to hook
webhooks together without the transmitting party having to configure
up all the endpoints users may want.

There's still a lot of work to do to make this *great*, but I'm
currently using it to trigger builds on go projects when upstream
software changes.
